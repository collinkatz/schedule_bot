# Discord Schedule Bot
## Author

## Goal
> The goal of this bot is to provide some minimal functionality to create a schedule, schedule events, display a calendar, make reservations, and even determine event priority via a bot in Discord. This is intended to make it easier to coordinate events and reservations with a large number of people on a discord server. The reason for this bot existing when there is already a Discord events service is to provide an easy way to display a calendar, and to allow non-admin users to schedule events. An event priority function can also be used to determine which events are more important than others, to allow for an easy way to place reservations for example on a room.

> An additional goal of this project is to create an easy and lightweight object oriented platform for handling a calendar and creating/storing events in a database in Python.

> This project was created for Loyola University Maryland Esports to schedule Esports lab hardware reservations for our many teams.
